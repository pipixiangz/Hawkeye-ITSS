The escalating necessity for safe and efficient transportation systems for cyclists necessitates the development of innovative solutions. This study pres

ents an Augmented Reality (AR) eyewear, a revolutionary system designed specifically to enhance cyclists' safety and navigation capabilities on the road. Unlike conventional cycling aids, which often lack real-time responsiveness and user-friendly interfaces, the AR eyewear integrates advanced detection and assistance technologies into a single, easy-to-use platform for cyclists, bikers, and personal mobility device users.


Specifically, we utilize an RGB-D camera for multi-object and multi-view detection, which provides critical information from the cyclists' blind spots and aids in real-time lane track segmentation. This solution also incorporates robust detection capabilities under varying light, weather, and traffic conditions.


Our tested various training strategy to ensure the efficiency and reliability of the proposed system. Initial results reveal substantial enhancements in situational awareness and decision-making in real-time traffic environments, thereby establishing the AR eyewear as a promising solution for safer and smarter cycling experiences.
